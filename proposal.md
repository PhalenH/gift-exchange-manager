## List of Tasks or Acceptance Criteria

```
As a user I want to be able to create or join a group, be assigned a group member as my gift exchange partner, and share my wishlist so that the other group members can see what gifts I want to receive.

When the user opens the app they have an option to sign in or sign up.

Once logged in to the app the user has the option to create a new group or join a pre-existing group given a group name and password.

Once logged in to the app the user has the option to add items to a wishlist which other group members will be able to view.

Each wishlist item can include a name, a price, and a link to the item.

Each group will have a group name, price limit, and event date.
