## Title

Gift Exchange Manager

## Description (1 paragraph)
An application will allows user and/or groups of users to manage their gift exchanges. The theme of the application relates to a holiday gift exchange. 

The application will have pages for each individual user. This page allows users to easily keep track of what gift exchanges they are apart of with family, friends, or with their employer. It will give a user the ability to create a wishlist that other group members can see so it is easier to determine what gift to purchase. On a user's page they will be able to see what who they have to purchase a gift for as well as a reminder on when the party/exchange is happening. A user can also create a new group from their own page.

The application will also have pages for each individual groups. This page makes it clean and easy to view other group members, when and where the exchange or part will occur, and additionally provide any rules around the exchange such as price limit for gifts or things that are not allowed to be purchased.

Overall the gift exchange manager will decrease any additional stress that people experience around the holidays, reduces the awkwardness of trying to find a good gift and allows people to purchase gifts that are more catered to another person's interests, and it keeps everything organized in a central location making it easier for larger groups to stay connected and informed.

## CSS Framework
- UIkit
- Bootstrap

## New Technology
- Email api/package that allows user to invite new/existing users to their group by providing an email. This will send the new/existing user an email where they can click the link and it will take them to the webpage and prompt them to sign up/sign in, and once that is done will add them to the group.

## List of Tasks or Acceptance Criteria

```
As a user I want to be able to create or join a group, be assigned a group member as my gift exchange partner, and share my wishlist so that the other group members can see what gifts I want to receive.

When the user opens the app they have an option to sign in or sign up.

Once logged in to the app the user has the option to create a new group or join a pre-existing group given a group name and password.

Once logged in to the app the user has the option to add items to a wishlist which other group members will be able to view.

Each wishlist item can include a name, a price, and a link to the item.

Each group will have a group name, price limit, and event date.
